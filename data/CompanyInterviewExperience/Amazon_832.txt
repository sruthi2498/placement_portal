Write a function rotate(ar[], d, n) that rotates arr[] of size n by d elements.

Rotation of the above array by 2 will make array

METHOD 1 (Using temp array)
Time complexity : O(n)
Auxiliary Space : O(d)

METHOD 2 (Rotate one by one)
To rotate by one, store arr[0] in a temporary variable temp,  move arr[1] to arr[0], arr[2] to arr[1] …and finally temp to arr[n-1]
Let us take the same example arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], d = 2
Rotate arr[] by one 2 times
We get [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 1] after first rotation and [ 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 1, 2] after second rotation.

METHOD 3 (A Juggling Algorithm)
This is an extension of method 2. Instead of moving one by one, divide the array in different sets
where number of sets is equal to GCD of n and d and move the elements within sets.
If GCD is 1 as is for the above example array (n = 7 and d =2), then elements will be moved within one set only, we just start with temp = arr[0] and keep moving arr[I+d] to arr[I] and finally store temp at the right place.
Here is an example for  n =12 and d = 3.  GCD  is 3 and

METHOD 4 (In-Place Rotation)
In this solution, the array is rotated in-place by computing the new index of the current value.
Algorithm:
1. Iterate over array
2. Find the new index of the current value with the formula:
    newIndex = (currentIndex – (no_of_rotation % array_length) + array_length) % array_length
3. Swap currentIndex value with newIndex value.
Here is an example for  n = 3.
Let arr[] be {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}. The values of array are taken as their index number to make the algorithm more readable and simple to understand.
Below is the implementation of the above approach:

Output :
Time complexity : O(n)
Auxiliary Space : O(1)
